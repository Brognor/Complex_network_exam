Atlas.py contain many example of graphs used

community.py library containing community detection with classic method and ricci flow

evolution.py library to realize the flow of a quantity over a graph

time test run the different algorithms calculating time vs number of nodes

datatime files contain the time data

plot realizes graphics of timetests

fit realize fit of timetest

dimension.py calculates the fractal dimension of the network

Einstein.py examine the possibility of an Einstein equation for networks by looking at
the relation between the fractal dimension and the ratio between the Ricci curvature and
our proposal for a network stress-energy tensor

Riccidiffusion.py realizes the diffusion of a quantity over a network using an algorithm 
based on curvature
